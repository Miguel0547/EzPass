# EzPass
* Run the EZ pass simulation.  This program reads a series of simulated  * EZ pass scan inputs from a data file and logs that information with an  * EZPassDB object.  After all of the scans have been processed, two reports  * are printed.  The first lists all the vehicles that are still on the  * Thruway.  The report lists the vehicles in sorted order based on the  * exit number where they entered the Thruway.  
* The second report lists  * billing information for each vehicle that completed a trip on the  * Thruway.
* This report is sorted in order by tag and then the exit  * number where the vehicle entered the Thruway.
